\chapter{Abstract} The aim of this research is to gain insight into the effect of strain on rare-earth (RE) ions doped in Yttrium Orthosilicate (YSO) by applying unaxial strain to the crystallographic axes. This spin system has exciting potential for future hybrid quantum devices due to accessible optical and microwave transitions. Therefore there is significant interest in coupling RE doped YSO to superconducting qubits or resonators. Therefore, the strain mechanisms arising at the interface between the systems due to rate of material compression at cryogenic temperatures may perturb the bulk properties of the spins. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of the systems response to strain could better guide device fabrication. In addition similar experimental investigations of donor spins in silicon (Si) has provided useful information regarding the shift in spin Hamiltonian coupling terms.
